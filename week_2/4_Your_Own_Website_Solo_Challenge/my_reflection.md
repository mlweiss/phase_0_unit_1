My Website url: user1011.github.io

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned that design plays a very large role in making a website look good. I found that while some techniques were still out of my reach, it was much more important to have a good blueprint of how I wanted the site to look. Moreover it was essentialy to plan out fonts, overall style, and color scheme beforehand. It was fun to look around at different color schemes and see what they would correspond to in terms of overall user experience. This is a very new process to me and I appreciated the chance to try it out for myself. I still would like to add a slideshow to my site and make it a little more impressive as it could end up being my calling card in the future. I foudn trying to implement these more complex features a bit out of my reach. I also would like to know how to make my own textured backgrounds from files with transparent backgrounds. 

It was not particularly difficult to apply the basic HTML and CSS skills that I had gained up until this point. But I didn't find any particular research source to be very helpful. Mostly just going through sites that I liked for inspiration was the key to this exercise.a
