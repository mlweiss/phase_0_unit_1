# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?


<p> My biggest time management challenge will be working on the projects while simultaneously studying for the first few weeks of Phase 0 and then traveling and doing research during the last few weeks. I will attempt to combat this by keeping a good work schedule for Phase 0 and implementing some time management techniques such as keeping a regular time of day and day of the week for doing Phase 0 work and doing it in short periods to keep me focused. My overall plan is to go beyond the material in Phase 0 to really solidify my understanding of these web development basics.
