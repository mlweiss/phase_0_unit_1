# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
 * Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Web standards are good. They ensure that all browsers load a site properly removing the necessity for rewriting the site for each browser. Furthermore they allow for greater readability of code between developers. They are also easier for search engines to find and index. I like the HTML5 elements since they provide a common structure for websites and give the code a cleaner look. They are not mandatory and one could use div's to handle everything if they didn't want to use the HTML5 elements. A reset.css file is necessary in order to reset the default CSS values in browsers to null. This way a website will be rendered as the designer intended on all browsers. On the topic of browsers, I usually use Chrome because I find the design to be pleasing and it opens and loads pages quickly. It also already has most of my passwords saved, so it is more convenient to use it than other browsers, which I have used less. I had not noticed that sites load different in different browsers, but I will check to see to what extent this phenomenon happens. I think it's not necessarily a good thing that they do this, but I imagine it might have something to do with optimizing load times and other performance issues for each browser. I found that the W3C pages on HTML5 and reset CSS were very helpful in explaining what was going on.
