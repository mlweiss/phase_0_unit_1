        <h3> Why Peer-Pairing in DBC?</h3>
        <p>
            Peer-pairing allows for a greater sharing of new ideas and provides a different resource 
            outside of reading and working by onesself. It can also bring a more positive atmosphere to the problem
            solving process and helps to solidify ideas through greater communication.

        <h3> Driver V Navigator</h3>
        <p>
            The driver-navigator analogy comes from the idea that one person is holding the map or directions and is 
            describing where the project/vehicle should go while the other person, the driver, follows the directions and 
            takes an active role in seeing to their implementation.
