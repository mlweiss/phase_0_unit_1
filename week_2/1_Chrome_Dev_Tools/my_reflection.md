# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The Document Object model is a programming interface for HTML and XML, providing a structure for the document that defines the way that the structure can be accessed from programs. The structure is a structured group of nodes and objects that have properties and methods. The DOM seems like a well structured representation of the 'code' underlying the page and is easily manipulated via the DevTools application in Chrome. It is well structured in my opinion I have found it a good resource for editing a page. What I have found difficult however is that sometimes changes are not implemented if it does not like the syntax, but I could not find any way to receive an error message to tell me when something is wrong. This might just be a general problem in HTML and CSS that we do not get any error messages from the compiler. Actually I should take a look into how these are compiled and rendered in a browser. Maybe there is a compiler dialog or a better way to understand this.

The wordpress.com site already had a lot of pre-existing features from the wordpress suite. My site was mostly editable and everything was written in HTML. Wordpress is written in HTML and PHP.

I found the Chrome Web Tools indispensable for this task. I often use it for editing my web pages so it was natural to use it for this exercise. I only wished that it provided a little more transparency when it does not allow changes to certain attributes rather than just crossing it out with a black line.

There were no "aha" moments for this project.
