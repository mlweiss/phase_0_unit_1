# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

<p> Responsive web design is the practice of designing a website to respond to changes in the device and browser type that is loading it. This means that the size of certain items will change and the look of the website will adapt to the medium with which you are viewing it. For example a site will be optimized to be rendered on a mobile phone or will respond to changes in the browser window size. I think it is generally good practice to have responsive web design if there is a high liklihood that users will try to access a site from many different devices. Otherwise it will be cumbersome to use and might not even be possible to access properly. </p>

Smartphones and tablets have required that developers adapt the design of pages to being rendered on much smaller screens of varying dimensions. It is likely that new technology like virtual reality and wearable technology like watches and google glass will make responsive web design even more essential for interacting with certain sites.

I did a little reading to see how visually impaired people use the web. It appears that they use screen readers that have synthetic speech systems that read out the contents of a page in a meaningful way for the user or produce a Braille display. I think that web designers should consider optimizing for this type of user if they think there is a high liklihood that there will be visually impaired people using the site or if the site is intended for use on a massive scale (like Google or Facebook). If it is for instance a picture blog, then it is unlikely that including features for the visually impaired would be a good use of development time.

I hadn't really noticed responsiveness in web design when browsing the web before doing this assignment. It was something that I experienced more or less implicitly up until this point. The idea of creating content that is specialized across all devices seems like a necessity now and I would look to make sure that sites I design has such specialization. As for web and design in general I am still working to get an eye for design features and appreciation of good web design, so I am not really in a position to comment on what is stupid or good about it yet.
