2. Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

I initially thought that the idea of everyone sharing their fears a bit strange and noticed more the deluge of emails from people I had not met yet telling me about what they are afraid of. I think that it is harder to put these fears in context when we all haven't had a chance to meet yet. I noticed that a lot of people were concerned about falling behind. I had not initially worried about that, but realizing how much time I spent working out some things that I thought would have gone a lot faster in HTML and CSS, I can understand their concern. Also reading through their reflections and fears made me realize how useful it will be to talk with them more about some tricks that they might know.
