## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
 HTML felt very fluid to me as I have used other typesetting languages in the past. I think that the environments and the nested environments all made sense and were easy to work with. I felt that having to type the brackets and the characteristic of each environment was a bit cumbersome. But I think that just takes a bit of getting used to. I am also still not sure I understand very well how to position objects on a page. I will need to look further into this.
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
 HTML seems to allow customization of font, color, size of font. The IDs and integration of CSS allow for this customization to be a bit more fluid. At first glance though, it seems like HTML by itself does not give the ability to create very stylish websites with lots of graphics and buttons.  
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
 There was a time when I wasn't exactly sure what the <title> part was doing. I had tried to include a header, so the tab in my browser always began with "<h1> ... " while I was editing. It took me a few minutes to realize why this was happening. 
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
  I found the resources provided to be quite helpful for this particular task.
