## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

<p> From the reading for this challenge it became clear that the most important stage of the design process is really the planning and brainstorming phase. Given that the ideas lend themselves to successful execution, the most significant resources should be devoted to having enough brainpower to think about and plan the blueprint for execution. This dovetails into the wireframing process where the general form of the site is stripped to its most basic components in order to more easily plan the function and layout of the site. This prevents getting distracted by detials and allows one to really contemplate how the form of the site should fit the desired function. </p>

<p> Reading about the important aspects of design, I came across a lot of new characteristics of a website on which to focus. It seems important to make sure that the layout and overall appearance of the website highlights the most important parts of the presentation so that the user does not feel overwhelmed or has to search too long for what he/she is looking for. Moreover I came to understand that with the increase in the amount of information generally presented to the end user, it is necessary to streamline and highlight the aspects that will be most important to them. The wireframing techniques were new and I believe will be helpful in planning out the websites that I will look to create. I enjoyed analyzing the websites that I chose; the process allowed me to look at them from a new perspective and really appreciate the way that they accomplished their individual goals.
