## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?



 I installed git on my linux and mac machines. I found that installing both didn't take to long. Setting up and cloning the repo properly was a bit harder and required looking up a few more resources on the internet. It also brought me the opportunity to learn some things about the vim text editor. Github is the remote directory where files are stored and available for access from any machine, while git is the local repo, meaning that files are stored on the hard drive of the computer. This distinction is made more clear by the fact that git is an application installed on a computer that is accessed via the command line.
 
 Version control is the practice of keeping track of the changes that you make to a file. It also allows different editors to branch off changes, allowing for multiple edits of the same file, which are also kept track of. Github keeps track of the edits and stores progress summaries along with each version. 
 
 On projects where there are multiple developers it makes sense to use version control as it is likely that one developer will not be able to oversee all the files at once. This way when someone else comes to look at the code they can see exactly what has changed since the last time that they used it. I think this is a very effective practice and essential for larger projects.
