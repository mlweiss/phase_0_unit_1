## 5. [HTML/CSS Solo Challenge](5_HTML_CSS_solo_challenge/readme.md) Reflection

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
  Beginning this project I had a lot of questions about how things are positioned using html and CSS. I found that the explanation given by http://alistapart.com/article/css-positioning-101 was very helpful. The explanation that there is a flow and that everything is a box that can be positioned relatively to other boxes helped me structure the site that I ultimately submitted.
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
  I have found CSS and HTML to be very fickle. I cannot say that I understand yet why I am able to turn on certain features in one div and not see them appear, while applying those same features such as a box shadow in a div contained within the previous one will. It still feels like a lot of trial and error to get a site to look the way that I would want it to. The positioning system also seems like it should be a bit more precise. Currently to make a two-column page, I just adjust the number of pixels from the left or right in order to position the columns next to each other. It seems like a better to solution to have them contained in one box each taking up a certain percentage of space (in my case preferably 70% and 30%).

I also am not sure how the link coloring works. I didn't really have a lot of time to play around with it, but I think I should try and read a little more about it in order to understand what is really going on.

* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
  I did learn a lot about relative and absolute position. I also feel that it is a good strategy to have containers liek a heading container and a content container. 

* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
 I feel confident with CSS and html, but I think that I could use some more work with pseudo selectors. It seems like the order with which you write them in the CSS code makes a difference and I think it will take a little more time to see how that works.

* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
  I enjoyed seeing how things in the end came close to looking like I envisioned. I think it will be cosiderably more enjoyable when I have a better command of the techniques and I feel like I am more competent at taking my drawn wire-frame ideas from paper to implementation.

* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
  I really found most of this challenge to be quite tedious. I found the instruction to be a bit random and it took me a lot of time to piece things together from various sources. I think I would have preferred to approach it from a different perspective, maybe creating a mock site via instructions rather than just throwing a bunch of things at the page. That being said, I am not altogether unhappy with my finished product. I just think that I will need to do a little more to advance my comprehension of what the code is really doing so the process of creating it doesn't feel like so much time and effort is being ineffciently spent. For instance messing around with the positions and trying to get the proper shadows was really quite laborious.
