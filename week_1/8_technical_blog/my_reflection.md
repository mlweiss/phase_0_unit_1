## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: https://github.com/user1011/user1011.github.io/blob/master/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I did not particularly enjoy this assignment. The subject is not one that I am particularly passionate about and I find that the task does not lend itself naturally to the way that I write or think. I am not used to thinking about design and I will have to work more on developing a voice that can talk about it knowledgably and maybe most importantly in an interesting way. I think being a bit more enthusiastic about this subject might be helpful to writing a better post. I felt quite confident having picked sites that accomplished their desired goals quite well and presented what feel like good design principles. I think it will be essential in the future to better explicate exactly what those principles are. And maybe that is what I take away most from this assignment: a desire to gain a better analytical eye for exactly what is going on here.
