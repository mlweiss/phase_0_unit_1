## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person

  To create a repository on GitHub is rather straightforward. There is a link on the website that prompts
  a user to fill in certain forms and give the repository a name. To clone the repository to my local computer, a 
  Linux machine running Fedora, I used the command line prompt. The commands "git clone [HTML URL].git" worked to do this.
  I also tried using git init in the command prompt to make a repository but found that I could not exit successfully the   commit message (when prompted to add a description of my commit I could not find the keyboard command to exit the text   editor)


* Describe what open source means

  The practice of open source software involves allowing free access to the code and anyone to customize it 
  and use it as they see fit.
  
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
  
  I personally have worked with a number of open source software libraries and even written code intended for their 
  use. I think that the practice is really the future of development of certain types of essential software. Knowledge
  should generally be free and accessible to everyone. I think something similar is going on with this movement.

* Assess the importance of using licenses
  
  Licenses are important for giving credit to the author and making it known under which circumstances open source
  material may be used in other projects and sources. In the case of GNU General Public License it also ensures that  
  open source software projects stay open source. It gives the author some authority in determining how the material 
  will be used, while also making it widely available.

* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
  
  My understanding of software licenses was expanded. I understood better how to build a repo, though the concept 
  was already familar from other projects. I struggled however with working with the commit process. I am still working
  that one out.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
  I found that the github explanation of the command line protocol for creating a repo helped. https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo
