## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?

* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned the difference between the internet and the web. The web is an application that can be accessed via the internet, while the internet is the term for the all-encompassing network of networks of computers and other devices. 

It is important to remember to keep a simplified style that allows for easy access to all of the documents. I felt quite relieved when I finally got the website up, I had initially not realized that this was a requirement in this particular challenge. The aha moment came when I realized that my [user name].github.io is actually a url that I can access. This took me some time to realize, but once I got this, everything kind of took off from there.
